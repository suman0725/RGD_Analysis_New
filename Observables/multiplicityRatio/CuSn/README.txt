I am going to make a tree, where data for the electron pi+ and pi- will be stored, 
but specifically REC::Particl Bank from the Hipo file. Then, I will use the tree to make
 the Vz histogram for Cu and Sn and use 3 sigma cut (based on the transeverse Cut at Vx and Vy ) 
 and separate the Cu and Sn. Then get the multiplicity ratio plot for them .
